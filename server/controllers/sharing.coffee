# ---Â Creation of the share document.
# The share document is a document that represents the sharing process that was
# initiated and that we store in the database for further use.
#
# The structure of a share document is as following
# shareDoc {
#   id        -> the id of the sharing process
#   fDoc      -> a filter on the documents to determine which documents need to
#                be shared
#   fUser     -> a filter on the users to determine to whom we need to share
#                the documents
#   desc      -> a description of the sharing process
#   docIDs[]  -> an array containing the ids of the documents to share. These
#                ids were determined thanks to the filter "fDoc"
#   targets[] -> an array containing the users to whom the documents will be
#                shared. This array contains "target" a custom structure that
#                will hold all the information required to share with that
#                particular user.
# }
#
# The structure target:
# target {
#   url           -> the url of the user's cozy
#   pwd           -> the password linked to the sharing process
#   replicationID -> the id generated by CouchDB for the replication. The
#                    replication is a process linked to Couch in order to
#                    replicate documents between Couch instances.
# }
#
# We suppose in this function that the data we receive is already in the
# correct format. That means we will receive a "share" object that has all its
# fields filled as needed.
